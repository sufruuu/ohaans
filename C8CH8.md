### **1. Tug-of-War – Understanding Balanced and Unbalanced Forces**
**Concepts Covered:**  
- Force as a push or pull  
- Balanced and unbalanced forces  
- Net force acting on an object  

**How to Conduct:**  
- Divide students into two equal teams and give them a **rope**.  
- Mark a centerline and have the teams pull in opposite directions.  
- Observe what happens when both teams pull with equal force (balanced force) and when one team pulls harder (unbalanced force).  

**How to Explain the Concept:**  
- If both teams apply **equal force**, the rope **does not move**, meaning forces are **balanced**.  
- When one team pulls harder, the **net force** is in their direction, making the rope move, demonstrating **unbalanced force**.  
- Relate this to real-life scenarios like **pushing a stalled car** or **a person pulling a heavy load**.

### **2. Football Kick – Exploring Force, Direction, and Motion**
**Concepts Covered:**  
- How force can start, stop, or change the motion of an object  
- The effect of applying force in different directions  

**How to Conduct:**  
- Place a **football** at the center of the field.  
- Have one student kick the ball **gently** and another kick it **harder**.  
- Observe the difference in **speed and distance** traveled.  
- Then, have a student **stop** the moving ball using their foot.  

**How to Explain the Concept:**  
- **Force makes an object move** (the kick starts the ball’s motion).  
- **Greater force increases speed** (harder kicks make the ball travel further).  
- **Force can stop motion** (placing a foot in the way stops the ball).  
- Relate this to **Newton’s First Law of Motion** (inertia).

### **3. Running with and Without a Backpack – Effect of Extra Force on Motion**
**Concepts Covered:**  
- The effect of mass on force and motion  
- Newton’s Second Law (F = ma)  

**How to Conduct:**  
- Mark a **20-meter running track** on the ground.  
- Have students run **once without any extra load** and then **again while wearing a weighted backpack**.  
- Measure and compare their running times.  

**How to Explain the Concept:**  
- **Extra mass (weight) requires more force to maintain speed.**  
- **With a backpack, friction between feet and ground increases**, making movement harder.  
- This explains **why sprinters wear lightweight clothes and shoes to minimize resistance**.

### **4. Basketball Bouncing – Air Pressure and Force Transmission**
**Concepts Covered:**  
- How force transfers through air pressure  
- The role of internal pressure in sports equipment  

**How to Conduct:**  
- Provide **three basketballs**:  
  1. **Properly inflated**  
  2. **Slightly deflated**  
  3. **Almost flat**  
- Have students **dribble each ball** and observe how they bounce.  

**How to Explain the Concept:**  
- A **properly inflated ball transfers force efficiently**, making it bounce higher.  
- A **deflated ball absorbs more force**, causing a weak bounce.  
- Relate this to **why footballs, volleyballs, and basketballs need proper air pressure**.

### **5. High Jump vs. Long Jump – Comparing Vertical and Horizontal Force**  
**Concepts Covered:**  
- How the **direction of applied force** affects motion  
- How gravity influences jump height and distance  

**How to Conduct:**  
- Set up a **high jump bar** and a **long jump pit** (or mark a sand pit for landing).  
- Have students attempt a **high jump** (applying force upwards) and a **long jump** (applying force forward).  
- Measure and compare the heights and distances achieved.  

**How to Explain the Concept:**  
- In **high jump**, force is applied **vertically**, counteracting **gravity** momentarily.  
- In **long jump**, force is applied at an **angle**, resulting in both **forward motion and upward motion**.  
- This explains **why sprinters generate forward momentum before jumping** in sports like **hurdles and pole vault**.

### **6. Weight Lifting Challenge – Understanding Force and Pressure Distribution**  
**Concepts Covered:**  
- How increasing mass affects required force  
- How distributing force reduces pressure  

**How to Conduct:**  
- Provide **different weights (e.g., water bottles, medicine balls, sandbags)**.  
- Have students lift a **lighter weight with one hand** and a **heavier weight with both hands**.  
- Compare how **easy or difficult** each attempt feels.  

**How to Explain the Concept:**  
- More **mass requires greater force to lift**.  
- **Using two hands spreads the force**, reducing **pressure on each hand**, making it easier to lift.  
- This explains why **weightlifters adjust their grip and stance to distribute weight evenly**.

### **7. Shot Put vs. Throwing a Ball – Effect of Force on Different Objects**  
**Concepts Covered:**  
- How mass affects acceleration (Newton’s Second Law: F = ma)  
- How different objects react to the same force  

**How to Conduct:**  
- Provide a **shot put (or a heavy ball)** and a **light rubber ball**.  
- Have students throw each object with the **same amount of effort** and observe which travels farther.  

**How to Explain the Concept:**  
- The **lighter ball** moves farther because it requires **less force** to accelerate.  
- The **shot put moves slower** and covers less distance due to its **higher mass**.  
- This demonstrates why **athletes train to maximize force in sports like javelin and discus throw**.

### **8. Basketball Free Throw – Understanding Projectile Motion**  
**Concepts Covered:**  
- How **angle, force, and gravity** affect the flight path of a ball  
- The concept of **optimal launch angles** in projectile motion  

**How to Conduct:**  
- Have students **shoot basketballs** toward a hoop from the **same spot** but using **different angles** (e.g., **low, medium, and high arcs**).  
- Record which angles result in the **highest scoring success**.  

**How to Explain the Concept:**  
- A **low-angle** shot travels fast but may hit the rim and miss.  
- A **high-angle** shot may go too high and lose momentum.  
- The **best angle (about 45°) balances speed and height**, explaining **why professional players use specific shot techniques**.

### **9. Long Jump with Run-Up – Effect of Friction and Speed on Jump Distance**  
**Concepts Covered:**  
- How **initial speed (momentum)** affects jump distance  
- The role of **friction** in acceleration  

**How to Conduct:**  
- Have students **attempt a long jump twice**:  
  1. **Without a run-up** (standing start)  
  2. **With a run-up** (momentum from sprinting)  
- Measure the distance of both jumps and compare results.  

**How to Explain the Concept:**  
- A **run-up increases speed**, meaning **more force is applied** at takeoff.  
- **Lower friction (e.g., smooth shoes or wet grass) reduces grip**, making jumping harder.  
- This explains **why long jumpers use a sprint approach and wear spiked shoes for traction**.
