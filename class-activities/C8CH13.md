# NCERT Textbook Activities

1.  **Ray Reflection Activity (Activity 13.1):**
    
    -   **Setup:** Fix a white sheet of paper on a flat surface. Using a comb with a single open gap (the rest covered with black paper), shine a torch through the gap to produce a narrow beam of light.
    -   **Activity:** Place a plane mirror in the path of the beam and ask students to observe the change in the light’s direction. Have them mark the incident and reflected rays on the paper and draw the normal.
    -   **Learning Outcome:**  
        • The laws of reflection: the equality of the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection.  
        • How light travels in straight lines and how it interacts with surfaces.  
        • The nature of plane mirrors and the formation of reflected rays.---

2.  **Measuring Angles of Reflection (Activity 13.3):**
    
    -   **Setup:** With a fixed mirror and a consistent light source, let students vary the angle of incidence using a protractor.
    -   **Activity:** Students measure and record the angle of incidence and corresponding angle of reflection, entering the data in a table.
    -   **Learning Outcome:** Reinforce that the angles are equal and learn to use measurement tools to gather scientific data.

3.  **Kaleidoscope Construction (Activity 13.6):**
    
    -   **Setup:** Provide students with mirror strips, a cardboard tube, colored glass or beads, and a transparent disc.
    -   **Activity:** Guide students through assembling a simple kaleidoscope by fixing three mirror strips inside the tube and adding the colorful materials at one end.
    -   **Learning Outcome:** 
	     • Multiple reflections and symmetry in images.  
        • How mirror arrangement can create ever-changing, beautiful patterns.  
        • The geometric relationship of angles in a reflective system, sparking creativity through art and science.

4.  **Exploring Dispersion (Activity 13.7):**
    
    -   **Setup:** Place a plane mirror in a bowl of water near a window so that sunlight reflects onto a white wall or paper.
    -   **Activity:** Adjust the setup until the reflected light splits into a spectrum of colors.
    -   **Learning Outcome:** 
	    • The dispersion of white light into its spectral colors.  
        • How light refracts and reflects through mediums like water and glass.  
        • The beauty of natural phenomena and the science behind the rainbow.
