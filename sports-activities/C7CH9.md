### 1. Sprinting with Stopwatches

**Activity:**  
Create a short sprint race course by marking a clear start and finish line with cones or chalk. Divide students into small groups and have them run a fixed distance (for example, 30 or 50 meters). Use stopwatches to record the time each student takes to complete the run.

**Demonstration & Understanding:**  
- **Showcase the Concept:** Begin by explaining the formula for speed:  
  **Speed = Distance ÷ Time.**  
  (Point out how every second counts and how the distance covered in that time reveals each runner’s speed.)  
- **Visual Connection:**  Plot their times on a simple distance-time graph. The straight line that forms for each consistent effort helps illustrate the concept of uniform motion.  
- **Encouraging Inquiry:**
    - What might make you run faster?  
    - How does your start impact your finish?

### 2. Rolling Ball Challenge

**Activity:**  
Mark a straight line on the ground using chalk or tape. In groups, students will gently roll a sports ball (such as a soccer or basketball) along the line. They should note the time when the ball crosses the start line and again when it comes to a stop.

**Demonstration & Understanding:**  
- **Live Demonstration:** Start by rolling the ball yourself, Letting students observe how the ball’s journey from start to finish is measured by time.  
- **Interactive Calculation:** Guide them through the calculation of speed using the formula:  
  **Speed = Distance ÷ Time.**  
  Discuss how the smooth, even roll corresponds to a near-uniform speed, just like many motions in sports.  
- **Deepening the Concept:** Encourage a conversation on factors such as friction and surface texture—how might a slightly bumpy ground alter the ball’s speed?

### 3. Agility Cone Course

**The Activity:**  
Set up an agility course with cones arranged in a zig-zag pattern. Have students weave in and out of the cones as quickly as possible. Use stopwatches to time their runs from start to finish.

**Demonstration & Understanding:**  
- **Dynamic Observation:** Begin with a slow demonstration, then ramp up to full speed. Let students observe how sharp turns and changes in direction affect overall speed and the calculation of average speed.  
- **Graphical Insight:** After a few rounds, encourage students to record their times and discuss the difference between constant speed and variable speed. They might even sketch a simple graph to show how their speed changes along the course.  
- **Reflective Discussion:**
    - How does changing direction affect your momentum?  
    - What might be done to improve both speed and agility?
